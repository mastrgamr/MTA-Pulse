    <string name="about_app">
        When making this app I had convenience and ease of use in mind. New York City is all about convenience,
        from the moment you open this app I wanted the user to be met with all viable and
        up to the minute information about the MTA subway system.\n
        As a student, who also works and travels frequently throughout all five boroughs
        of the city, I felt there was something missing in the current offering of transit apps
        that cater to the city; convenience, information, <u>and</u> ease of use.
